# What it does
  Normally, all the LED will be closed. A red dot will scan through the LEDs in one direction quickly. Pressing the right button will turn on the LED that the red scanner is on. The speed of the lights is very quick, but the player can scream and make noises to slow down the LED. If the right button is pressed mistakenly when the LED is already on, it will turn back off.
  There is also a cooldown for the button which avoids player press non stop and win too easily. 

The goal is to turn all the LEDs on. When all the LEDs are turned on, a winning tune will play.
