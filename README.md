# What it does
  Normally, all the LED will be closed. Each LED will start popping out as red in one direction quickly. Pressing the right button will turn on the LED thatâ€™s red. The speed of the lights is very quick, but the player can scream and slow down the LED. If the right button is pressed mistakenly when the LED is already on, it will turn back off.

The goal is to turn all the LEDs on. When all the LEDs are turned on, a winning tune will play.
